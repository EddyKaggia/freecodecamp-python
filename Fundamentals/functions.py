# Built-in Functions in Python
# ------------------------------
# There are 2 built-in functions that help with numbers:

# abs() -> returns the absolute value of a number.
print(abs(2.567)) # prints 2.567
print(abs(-2.567)) # prints 2.567

# round() -> given a number, returns its value rounded to the nearest integer:
print(round(2.567)) # prints 3

round(0.12) #0
# You can specify a second parameter to set the decimal point's precision:

round(0.12, 1) #0.1
# Several other math utility functions and constants are provided by the Python standard library:

# the math package provides general math functions and constants
# the cmath package provides utilities to work with complex numbers.
# the decimal package provides utilities to work with decimals and floating point numbers.
# the fractions package provides utilities to work with rational numbers.
