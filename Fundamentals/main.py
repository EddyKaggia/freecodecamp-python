# -------------------
# & -> performs binary AND
# | -> perfOrms binary OR
# ^ -> performs a binary XOR operation
# ~ -> performs a binary NOT operation
# << -> shift left operation
# >> -> shift right operation

# IS AND IN OPERATORS
# ---------------------
# is -> identity operator, and compares two objects. If they are the same it returns true
# in -> membership operator, and checks if a value exists in a sequence like a list
